## AI Weather Forecast Web Application

AI Weather App with ChatGPT-4 is a web application that presents a chatbot powered by ChatGPT-4, a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech. The chatbot can provide weather information and forecasts for any location in the world, as well as respond to inquiries and generate jokes about the weather.

The application is built using Next.js 13.3, a full-stack React framework that supports features such as file-based metadata API, dynamic open graph images, static export for app router, and parallel routes and interception. The application also uses Tremor 2.0, a React library to facilitate the creation of dashboards, which provides modular components for displaying data and charts.

The application connects to Open-Meteo API, using StepZen, a GraphQL-as-a-service platform that assists developers in building APIs fast and with less code. The application leverages GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows clients to request the information.
